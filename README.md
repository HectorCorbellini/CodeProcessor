## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.2 or higher (must be accessible as 'python3')
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment support

For detailed Python installation instructions for Puppy Linux distributions, please refer to [pyINSTALL.md](../pyINSTALL.md).

### Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üöÄ Direct Running

The application can be run directly from the project directory without cloning the repository, as long as the required dependencies are installed. This is particularly useful for quick testing or development purposes.

To run directly:
```bash
python main.py
```

## üì¶ Creating Standalone Executable

You can create a standalone executable that can be distributed and run without requiring Python or any dependencies to be installed on the target system.

### Automatic Windows Build (via GitHub Actions)

The Windows executable is automatically built and released through GitHub Actions:

1. The Windows executable is built whenever changes are pushed to the main branch
2. The executable is available in two locations:
   - GitHub Releases: https://github.com/yourusername/CodeProcessor/releases
   - GitHub Actions Artifacts: https://github.com/yourusername/CodeProcessor/actions
3. The build process includes:
   - Setting up Python 3.11 on Windows
   - Installing required dependencies
   - Creating a single-file executable
   - Creating a GitHub release

#### Current Build Status

As of the latest update, the Windows build through GitHub Actions is experiencing some issues. We're working to resolve these, but in the meantime, there are alternative methods to run the application on Windows:

1. **Run from source code**:
   - Install Python 3.11.2 or higher on Windows
   - Clone or download this repository
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate it: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run the application: `python main.py`

2. **Use Wine on Linux to run Windows applications**:
   - If you're on Linux and want to run Windows applications, you can use Wine or PlayOnLinux
   - Install Wine: `sudo apt-get install wine` or equivalent for your distribution
   - Install PlayOnLinux: `sudo apt-get install playonlinux`
   - Once the Windows executable is available, you can run it through Wine

3. **Manual Windows build**:
   - If you need to build the Windows executable yourself:
   - Follow the "Run from source code" steps above
   - Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
   - Create the executable: `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name CodeProcessor main.py`
   - The executable will be in the `dist` directory

You can track the official build status at:
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/HectorCorbellini/CodeProcessor/actions

### Manual Linux Build

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Create the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name CodeProcessor main.py
   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` directory:
   ```bash
   dist/CodeProcessor
   ```

   Note: The Linux executable is already available in the `dist` folder of this repository.

4. You can now distribute this executable to users who don't need to have Python installed.

## üöÄ Usage

### Linux/MacOS

1. **Launch the application** by running `python main.py`
2. **Select files** by either:
   - Dragging and dropping a directory onto the drop zone
   - Clicking the drop zone to open a file browser
3. **Process files** by clicking the "Process Files" button
4. The formatted code is **copied to your clipboard**
5. **Paste the code** into your preferred AI platform

### Windows

#### Option 1: Using the Windows Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the latest Windows distribution from:
   - GitHub Releases: https://github.com/HectorCorbellini/CodeProcessor/releases
   - Or directly from the project repository: [CodeProcessor_Windows.zip](https://github.com/HectorCorbellini/CodeProcessor/blob/main/CodeProcessor_Windows.zip)
2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
3. Open a command prompt as administrator and navigate to the extracted folder
4. Run the installer:
   ```cmd
   install_codeprocessor.bat
   ```
5. The installer will:
   - Check if Python is installed (installs Python 3.11 if needed)
   - Create a proper installation directory
   - Set up a virtual environment
   - Install all required dependencies
   - Create a desktop shortcut
6. Once installation is complete, you can:
   - Click the desktop shortcut to launch the application
   - Or run `run_codeprocessor.bat` from the installation directory

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the installer, you can install manually:

1. Install Python 3.11.2 or higher from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the Windows distribution ZIP file and extract it
3. Open a command prompt in the extracted directory
4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```cmd
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```cmd
   run_codeprocessor.bat
   ```

#### Option 3: Using the Standalone Executable

If you prefer to use the standalone executable:

1. Download the Windows distribution ZIP file
2. Extract it to your desired location
3. Double-click `CodeProcessor.exe` to launch the application

Note: The standalone executable requires Python to be installed on your system, but it doesn't require a virtual environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Code Processor application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**: 
   - Initializes the application
   - Sets up the UI
   - Handles user interactions

2. **Configuration Management (`app_config.py`)**: 
   - Manages application settings
   - Handles language and appearance preferences

3. **File Processing (`file_processor.py`, `file_utils.py`)**: 
   - Processes directories and files
   - Formats code for AI platforms
   - Handles file operations

4. **UI Components (`ui_components.py`, `ui_factory.py`)**: 
   - Creates and manages UI elements
   - Implements drag and drop functionality
   - Handles appearance mode changes

5. **Internationalization (`texts.py`)**: 
   - Manages text constants in multiple languages
   - Provides language switching functionality

6. **Error Handling and Logging (`error_handler.py`, `logger.py`)**: 
   - Centralizes error handling
   - Configures logging throughout the application

### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating UI components
- **Decorator Pattern**: Used for error handling
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used for configuration and logging

## üåê Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages through the `texts.py` module:

- Currently supported languages: English (en) and Spanish (es)
- Language can be changed programmatically through the `set_language` function
- All UI text is stored in language-specific dictionaries

To add a new language:
1. Create a new dictionary in `texts.py` (e.g., `FR_TEXTS`)
2. Add the language code to `LANGUAGE_TEXTS`
3. Implement language switching in the UI if desired

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Open a pull request
